= confluencer

Easy to use, ActiveRecord-like classes to find spaces, pages and bookmarks as well as adding new ones and updating existing ones. Very much work in progress, every version will most likely break your code. I will update the README when the codebase is more stable.

Uses the Confluence XMLRPC API (v1).

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
